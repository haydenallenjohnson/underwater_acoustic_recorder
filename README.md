# underwater_acoustic_recorder

This repository contains directions for the construction and use of a 2-channel underwater acoustic recorder. The system is based around a TASCAM DR-40X, which is housed in a BlueRobotics pressure casing and connected to two Aquarian Scientific AS-1 hydrophones. A detailed desctiption is contained in the manual, included here as a PDF, `underwater_acoustic_recorder_user_manual.pdf`. The code running on the onboard microcontroller is also provided in the file `feather_software.ino`.
